    "A navigation app wants to distinguish itself from its competitors and gain market share by offering users a \"safest route\" option. When this option is selected, a route is specifically designed to circumvent locations where severe accidents are more likely to occur given the junction type and road, weather, and light conditions. For this purpose, a machine learning model is developed."
